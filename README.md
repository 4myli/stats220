## STATS 220 🐱🍰⭐️

Kia ora, my name is Amy, I am a second year University student.
* This is my repo for STATS220, 2024.
* I have zero experience in coding so I am currently learning how to use R!
### What is this repo?
1. I am in the process of learning code so I can complete some projects throughout this semester 😁
2. This repo will be for the projects I make so **hopefully** I can make a portfolio.

I hope this is able to explain what this repo is!

I really like monkeys, so here is a picture of a baby Japanese Macaque. I hope you like it too ☺️
